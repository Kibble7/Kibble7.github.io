## 📖 Projects ⚙️

### 🔒 Phishing Simulation
**phishing simulation project** to help organizations improve their ### 🔒 Phishing Simulation Project

This **phishing simulation project** is designed for educational purposes, aiming to help individuals understand how phishing attacks work and how they can fall victim to common social engineering tactics. The project involves creating **fake web pages** using tools like **Azure** and **Apache web servers** to simulate phishing scenarios. These pages are designed to mimic legitimate websites in order to capture user credentials. The project also demonstrates how attackers could use these fake pages to trick individuals into entering sensitive information. It's a hands-on approach to learning about the **basic techniques of phishing attacks** and how they can be prevented.
