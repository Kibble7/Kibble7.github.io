Scenario: You’ve been hired as a penetration tester to assess network security across two internal ranges: 10.5.5.0/24 and 192.168.0.0/24. Your mission? Locate and exploit vulnerabilities across various systems and uncover the hidden flags—each representing a successful breach.

  <h1>Final Capstone Activity</h1>  
  <p><strong>Background / Scenario:</strong> You have been hired to conduct a penetration test for a customer. At the conclusion of the test, the customer has requested a complete report that includes any vulnerabilities discovered, successful exploits, and remediation steps to protect vulnerable systems. You have access to hosts on the <code>10.5.5.0/24</code> and <code>192.168.0.0/24</code> networks.</p>

  <h2>Challenges</h2>
  <ol>
    <li><strong>Challenge 1:</strong> Use SQL injection to find a flag file.</li>
    <li><strong>Challenge 2:</strong> Use web server vulnerabilities to investigate directories and find a flag file.</li>
    <li><strong>Challenge 3:</strong> Exploit open Samba shares to access a flag file.</li>
    <li><strong>Challenge 4:</strong> Analyze a Wireshark capture file to find the location of a file containing flag information.</li>
  </ol>

  <h2>Objectives</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Perform reconnaissance and identify vulnerable services.</li>
    <li>Use exploitation techniques to retrieve sensitive data or access flag files.</li>
    <li>Document discovered vulnerabilities and extracted flags.</li>
    <li>Propose remediation strategies to secure the vulnerable systems.</li>
  </ul>
