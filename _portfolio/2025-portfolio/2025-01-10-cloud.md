# 🌩️ Cloud+ Lab Documentation (Azure & AWS)

Welcome to my Cloud+ lab documentation. This document contains hands-on experience and configurations completed using **Microsoft Azure** and **Amazon Web Services (AWS)**. It is structured according to the **CompTIA Cloud+ (CV0-003)** exam objectives, covering key domains such as cloud architecture, security, deployment, operations, and troubleshooting.

Each section includes a summary of what I performed during the labs, along with notes, configurations, and best practices observed.
