# 🖥️ Server+ Lab Documentation

This document outlines my practical work and study notes aligned with **CompTIA Server+ (SK0-005)** objectives. The Server+ certification focuses on server architecture, administration, storage, security, troubleshooting, and disaster recovery — across both on-prem and hybrid environments.

---

## 🧱 1. Server Architecture

### ✅ Physical vs Virtual Servers
- Compared hardware components (CPU, RAM, NICs, RAID controllers).
- Deployed and configured virtual machines using Hyper-V and VMware ESXi.

### ✅ Rack and Blade Server Setup
- Identified rack unit standards (1U, 2U, etc.).
- Cabled and labeled server racks following best practices.

---

## ⚙️ 2. Server Administration

### ✅ OS Installation and Configuration
- Installed Windows Server and various Linux distributions (Ubuntu, CentOS).
- Configured BIOS/UEFI settings and updated firmware.

### ✅ Roles and Features
- Set up DNS, DHCP, File Server roles on Windows Server.
- Deployed Samba and Apache on Linux-based servers.

---

## 💽 3. Storage

### ✅ Storage Technologies
- Configured RAID levels (0, 1, 5, 10) using hardware and software controllers.
- Compared DAS, NAS, and SAN environments.

### ✅ Backup and Restore
- Performed backups with Windows Server Backup and `rsync`.
- Tested restoration scenarios using bare-metal recovery and snapshot-based methods.

---

## 🔐 4. Security and Access Control

### ✅ Physical Security
- Implemented badge readers and security camera placement strategies.
- Configured secure rack cabinets and lockable server rooms.

### ✅ User Permissions and Access
- Managed user/group permissions in Active Directory and Linux ACLs.
- Implemented 2FA for remote server access (SSH + MFA).

---

## 🧯 5. Troubleshooting and Disaster Recovery

### ✅ Hardware Diagnostics
- Identified failing components using vendor tools (Dell OMSA, HP iLO).
- Replaced memory, hard drives, and power supplies.

### ✅ Disaster Recovery Procedures
- Documented recovery plans and RTO/RPO definitions.
- Simulated disaster recovery drills using backed-up images.

---

## 🧰 Tools and Scripts

- Used `ipmitool`, `lshw`, and `top` for diagnostics.
- Wrote Bash/PowerShell scripts to automate monitoring and patching.
