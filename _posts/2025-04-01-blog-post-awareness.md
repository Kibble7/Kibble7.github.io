<p style="font-size: 18px; color: #333; line-height: 1.6;">
<b>Social engineering</b> is when someone tricks you into giving away personal information or doing something you shouldnâ€™t. They might pretend to be someone you trust, like a friend or company.
</p>

<h3 style="color: #1a73e8;">Protect Yourself:</h3>
<ul style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.6;">
  <li>Donâ€™t trust strangers asking for personal info.</li>
  <li>Verify before giving out details.</li>
  <li>Think before clicking on links.</li>
  <li>Stay cautious and always double-check before sharing anything important.</li>
</ul>

<h2 style="color: #1a73e8;">Social Engineering Attacks</h2>
<p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.6;">
Scammers use social engineering tactics like phishing, pretexting, and baiting to manipulate individuals into revealing sensitive information. They create fake scenarios to gain trust and exploit human behavior. Stay aware of these methods to avoid falling victim. Always verify requests and be cautious with unfamiliar communications.
</p>

<h2 style="color: #1a73e8;">Account, Device, and Identity</h2>
<p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.6;">
Consider the security of your account, device, and identity based on priority. Scammers target these areas through phishing, pretexting, and other manipulative tactics. Protect your personal information by staying alert and verifying requests. Prioritize securing your accounts and devices to safeguard your identity from theft.
</p>

<h2 style="color: #1a73e8;">Secure Your Devices</h2>
<p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.6;">
One of the most effective ways to secure your device is by keeping your software up to date. Always install the latest updates for your operating system, apps, and antivirus software. Updates fix security vulnerabilities that hackers might exploit.
</p>

<h2 style="color: #1a73e8;">Protect Your Identity</h2>
<p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.6;">
Keeping your identity safe not only protects you but also helps secure businesses and the digital world. Good security habits lower the chances of cyberattacks, fraud, and data breaches, benefiting individuals, companies, and organizations.
</p>

<h2 style="color: #1a73e8;">Know Your Digital Footprint</h2>
<p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.6;">
Open-Source Intelligence (OSINT) refers to gathering publicly available information from online sources. It helps people understand how much personal data they leave behind and how they can monitor their own digital footprint.
